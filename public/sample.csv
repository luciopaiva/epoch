"Inventions",1,"Vulcanized rubber","1844-06-15","","Rubber, so named because it could erase pencil writing, had long been considered a waterproofing agent, but in its natural state, it melted in hot weather and froze solid in the cold. After ten years of tireless work and abject poverty, Charles Goodyear perfects his process for "vulcanizing" rubber, or combining it with sulfur to create a soft, pliable substance unaffected by weather. Patented on June 15, 1844.","http://www.ideafinder.com/history/Inventions/goodyear.htm"
